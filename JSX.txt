1)JavaScript XML (JSX) - Extension to the JavaScript language syntax.

2)Write XML-like Code for Elements and Components.

**)Without using JSX we can create the React Applications , by using createElement()method , in which we can pass three Parameter , where as first Parameter is our element
and second Parameter is option Property i.e null and third is our text msg.at last at the
place of null parameter , we can pass the Object means null Parameter is basically object
of key value press that will be applied to elements.
